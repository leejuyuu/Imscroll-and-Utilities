% This function should have the same effect at hitting the 'spotsbutton' in
% the imscroll gui, but here we will return the updated handles structure
% so the calling function can update its copy of the handles.  We were
% having problems with getting the handles to update AllSpots when the 'spotsbutton'
% was invoked to find all the spots (when removing AOIs that lack any spot
% within them).
