%
% function proximity_mapping_v1(mappingpoints,xyin,numpoints,fitparmvector0,outfield)
%
% This function will map between fields using a restricted set from the
% list in mappingpoints to determine a set of mapping fit parameters (fitparmvector)
% Specifically, we will use a number of the mappingpoints 'numpoints'
% that lie closest to the input point xyin=[xin yin] to determine the mapping
% fit parameters fitparmvector.
%
% mappingpoints == the Nx12 set of points from the mapping gui used for mapping
%              between the fields.  The form is
% [frm#1   ave1  x1  y1  pixnum1  aoinum1   frm#2  ave2 x2 y2 pixnum2 aoinum2]
%
% xyin == [xin yin] xy pair of input points that will be mapped to the other field
% numpoints== the number of closest xy pairs to use from the mappingpoints
%         list.  For example, with numpoints=15 we use the 15 points in the
%         mappingpoints list that lie closest to the [xin yin] input pair
% fitparmvector0== the fitparmvector likely stored already from the mapping
%         gui.  This will be used as a starting parameter for the fits
%         performed in this routine
% outfield == 1 if we are mapping from field 2 to field 1 (xyin is from field2)
%             2 if we are mapping from field 1 to field 2 (xyin is from field 1)
%
% The output will be a single xy pair [xout yout]

% v1: 10/29/2012 Larry Friedman changed 2->1 mapping so that parameters are actually fit
%    as opposed to just inverting the transformation 1->2
